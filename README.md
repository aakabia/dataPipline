## Installation
To install this application, clone the code from my GitHub repository, create a .env file with all the required environment variables, and run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies. Please view the video link Above for reference.

## Usage
The purpose of this application is to provide data that can help create beginner-friendly and consistent workout routines for users. The data includes exercise instructions, examples, the exercise itself, and its targeted muscle groups. Future development will focus on incorporating nutritional data and building a user interface to display the information.

## Test
To test the application, first run the schema file located in the db folder, then start your server. Once the server is running, you should be able to access the routes defined for retrieving all data or a single data entry. I recommend using Insomnia to test and interact with the API routes.
